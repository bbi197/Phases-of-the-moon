Moon Phases Page
This web project showcases the various moon phases in a smooth scrolling, visually immersive experience. As you scroll down the page, each moon phase image appears with a smooth fade-in effect, scaling up slightly to add a dynamic feel. The header at the top of the page displays a ribbon of all moon phases, and as the user scrolls, each moon phase is displayed one by one, with each image covering the entire screen.
